    <h2>Welcome,</h2>

<p> 
Andrzej Piotr Kądzielawa (Ostrava, Czechia) is a theoretical physicist and HPC specialist.
</p>

<p> 
He earned his PhD in Physics in Prof. Józef Spałek's group at Jagiellonian University (Kraków, Poland) in 2015 with <i>summa cum laude</i> honors following his 4-year work on his original quantum chemical method applied in the theoretical condensed matter physics.
This included high-performance computations on the elecronic structure of solid hydrogen, completed using an original open-sourced library <a href="https://bitbucket.org/azja/qmt">qmt</a> created together with Dr. Andrzej Biborski.
</p>

<p> 
Since 2011 he workes and teaches at Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science at Jagiellonian University (cf. <a href="/teaching.html">Teaching</a> section).
He coordinated acquisition of computational cluster for Department of Condensed Matter Theory, which he administers ever since.
In September 2018 he has also got a position as Reasercher in the National Supercomputing Centre <i>IT4Innovations</i> at the Technical University of Ostrava (Czech Republic).</p>
