<p> 
Andrzej Piotr Kądzielawa (Kraków, Poland &amp; Ostrava, Czechia) is a theoretical physicist and HPC specialist.
</p>

<p> 
He earned his PhD in Physics in Prof. Józef Spałek's group at Jagiellonian University (Kraków, Poland) in 2015 with <i>summa cum laude</i> honors, following his development of an original quantum chemical method (EDABI), applied in the theoretical condensed matter physics.
This included high-performance computations on the elecronic structure of solid insulating and metallic hydrogen, as well as the statistical and qualitative analysis of large quantities of results.
</p>

<p>
He is a co-author of high-performance computational library <i><a href="https://bitbucket.org/azja/qmt/src/master/">Quantum Metallization Tools</a> (qmt)</i>.
</p>

<p> 
Since 2011 he works and teaches at Marian Smoluchowski Institute of Physics, Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science, Jagiellonian University (cf. <a href="/teaching.html">Teaching</a> section).
He coordinated acquisition of computational cluster for Department of Condensed Matter Theory, which he administers ever since.
In September 2018 he became reasercher in Modeling for Nanotechnology Lab at the National Supercomputing Centre <i>IT4Innovations</i>, Technical University of Ostrava (Czech Republic).</p>
