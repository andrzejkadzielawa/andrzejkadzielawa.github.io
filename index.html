Andrzej Piotr Kądzielawa (Kraków, Poland) is a theoretical physicist and data engineer.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
He earned his PhD in Physics in Prof. Józef Spałek's group at Jagiellonian University (Kraków, Poland) in 2015 with <i>summa cum laude</i> honors, following his development of an original quantum chemical method (EDABI), applied in the theoretical condensed matter physics.
This included high-performance computations on the elecronic structure of solid insulating and metallic hydrogen, as well as the statistical and qualitative analysis of large quantities of results.
</p>

<p align="justify">
He is a co-author of high-performance computational library <i><a href="https://bitbucket.org/azja/qmt/src/master/">Quantum Metallization Tools</a> (qmt)</i> and
an author of generic framework for mapping density functional theory output onto the Heisenberg model <i><a href="https://github.com/Mellechowicz/JorG">JorGpi</a></i>.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
From January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022, he was the Principal Investigator of <a href="https://gacr.cz/file-download/45672">GA&#268;R standard grant</a> No. 20-18392S <i>Tailoring thermal stability of W-Cr based alloys for fusion applications</i> (cz. <i>Modifikace teplotn&#237; stability slitin na b&#225;zi W-Cr pro aplikaci ve f&#250;zn&#237;ch reaktorech</i>).
